# Docker Swarn Demo

In here, I wrtie some note during learning docker swarn. There are three step here:
- Step1: Build a Cluster and management by using docker swarm
- Step2: Create redis service in this Cluster
- Step3: Create Backend Service and combine into the redis service created in step2.
